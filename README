This plugin was created to limit which activities are written to the Activity
Log (and hence the internal mt_log table in the database).

Specifically, it adds a new mt-config.cgi setting: LogExclude. LogExclude takes
a comma separated list of log categories to exclude from the activity log;
messages in those categories are simply ignored and will never reach the db.

For example:

    LogExclude straight_search

would stop all searches from being logged.
